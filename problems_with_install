At 17.03.2024 I've installed arch from this instruction on my new desktop.
Here are what problem I've encountered, which should be fixed:
1. [ ] installation process was interrupted by starting of hyprland, so I couldn't finish it, and majority of programs and settings wasn't installed
2. [ ] yay -S command was stuck on "tydying install" step, I'm not sure which package was causing it
3. [ ] docker needs root to work, fix for running without root should be in automatic config
